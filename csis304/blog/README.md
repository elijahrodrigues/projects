## Description: The capstone project from my Web Based Programming course at George Fox univerity. I used RESTful API's to create and load post, edit them, reply to them, and delete replies. This project required inuitive use of CSS and HTML, and a the ability to build a whole web app using Javascript. 

## I built the project in VS code with a remote SSH connection the instructors private server. I effectively used multiple JS files for orginizational purposes. 

## This project gave me confidence in Javascript, the use of REST API's, CSS, HTML, and Visual Studio Code.
